## Why Motherless Downloader

Motherless often exposes video through player config blocks or direct CDN-backed file URLs, but that still does not make saving the correct file convenient. Generic tools can miss the real media source or leave you sorting through multiple irrelevant assets.

Motherless Downloader is built to reduce that friction. Open the page, let the extension detect the active media source, choose the available quality, and export the result as MP4 without leaving the browser.

## Features

- Detects supported Motherless media from active watch pages
- Multi-source video detection including flashvars, HTML5 video, and inject script monitoring
- Handles direct-file and supported player-backed download flows
- In-page download button built into the video player
- Lists available quality variants when present
- Right-click context menu for quick downloads
- Saves output as MP4 for broad playback compatibility
- Automatic saving into a dedicated MOTHERLESS folder
- Works on Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Firefox, Whale, and Yandex

## How It Works

1. Install the extension from the latest release.
2. Open Motherless and visit a video page.
3. Start playback so the extension can detect the stream.
4. Open the popup or use the in-page download button.
5. Choose the quality or stream option you want.
6. Download the video as MP4.
7. Save the final file locally.

9. Open the saved file from your Downloads folder.

## Supported Formats

- Input: supported Motherless video sources (HLS, direct MP4)

Saved files use MP4 so they are easier to replay on standard media players, move between devices, or archive locally.

## Who It's For

- Motherless viewers who want offline copies of supported videos
- Users archiving media they can already access in the browser
- People who want a browser extension instead of manual URL extraction
- Users who need a simple MP4 export workflow
- Anyone who wants cleaner download controls than generic downloader sites

## Common Use Cases

- Save a Motherless video for later viewing
- Export the available quality as MP4
- Avoid manual parsing of page source for direct file URLs
- Keep local copies for offline playback
- Use the in-page button or right-click menu for a faster download flow

## Troubleshooting

**The extension does not detect the video**
Press play first and wait for the page to initialize the active source.

**No quality selector appears**
Some pages expose only one usable source, so only one option may be available.

**The detected stream looks incomplete**
Refresh the page and retry after starting playback again.

**The download stopped partway through**
Check whether your internet connection dropped during the download.

**The page requires account access**
The extension only works on media you can already open and play in your active browser session.
